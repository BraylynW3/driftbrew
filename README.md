# Driftbrew ☕  
A cozy mobile coffee journaling app built with Expo, React Native, and TypeScript. This app was built as a final project in my IST-236 class at HGTC. 
The app aims to connect coffee lovers with smaller and less known cafes. It allows user to discover new cafes near them, search by tags such as having wifi, and 
journal their recent coffee orders and their rating for the order and cafe. 

## Features
- Light/Dark theme support (auto toggled from profile)
- Log brews with name, café, date, and photo
- Browse a scrollable list of recent brews
- Profile screen with editable display name + settings
- Custom fonts, gradients, and a soft, aesthetic vibe

## Tech Stack
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) + React Native
- React Navigation (Native Stack + Bottom Tabs)
- TypeScript
- Context API for state management
- `expo-font`, `expo-linear-gradient`, and more!
